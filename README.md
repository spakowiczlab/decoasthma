Code to reproduce the analyses described in the manuscript, "Approaches for integrating heterogeneous RNA-seq data reveals cross-talk between microbes and genes in asthmatic patients," in which we describe a method we dubbed LDA-link for relating microbes to genes within heterogeneous or noisy RNA-seq data. 

The manuscript has been posted on bioRxiv, here:

 And is currently under review at Genome Biology.

The data are being submitted to dbGaP under BioProject SUB7102729 and is available through academic collaboration. Please contact daniel.spakowicz@osumc.edu with any questions.
